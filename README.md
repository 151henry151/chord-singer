# Chord Singer - AI Music Coach

An innovative AI-powered music learning tool that helps musicians internalize harmonic structures and chord progressions by ear.

## Concept

Chord Singer transforms any song into a unique learning experience by:
1. **Upload**: Users upload a song file
2. **Analyze**: The system analyzes the audio to extract chord progressions and timing
3. **Generate**: An AI voice sings the original melody but replaces lyrics with chord names
4. **Learn**: Musicians can hear and internalize chord progressions naturally

## Features (Planned)

- 🎵 Audio file upload and processing
- 🎼 Automatic chord detection and analysis
- 🤖 AI voice synthesis with chord names
- ⏱️ Synchronized chord timing with original melody
- 🎸 Support for various guitar tunings
- 📱 Web-based interface
- 🎧 Real-time preview and playback

## Tech Stack (Proposed)

- **Backend**: Python with FastAPI
- **Audio Processing**: librosa, essentia, or similar
- **Chord Detection**: Machine learning models for chord recognition
- **AI Voice**: Text-to-speech with musical capabilities
- **Frontend**: React/Next.js with modern UI
- **Audio**: Web Audio API for real-time processing
